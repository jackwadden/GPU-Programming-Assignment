This assignment is meant to teach undergraduate/graduate level programmers basic GPU programming by having them write a parallel findMax() reduction in the CUDA programming language. 
-- Question 1 is meant to familiarize the student with host-side kernel invocation. 
-- Question 2 is meant to introduce the idea of shared memory as a low-latency, software managed scratchpad. 
-- Question 3 introduces thread level parallelism within thread-blocks. 
-- Question 4 optimizes the solution to Question 3, highlighting the impact of control flow divergence within a SIMD instruction. 

NOTE: this is meant to follow a lecture introducing modern GPU architecture and the CUDA programming language.
